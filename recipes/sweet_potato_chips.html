    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sweet potato chips are a great healthy side dish that can go with just about anything!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large (8 ounces) sweet potato</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice potato into 1/16-inch-thick rounds using a mandoline. Put potato slices in a large bowl of cold water; soak about 20 minutes. Drain and pat dry with paper towels. Wipe out bowl.</li>
        <li>Return potato slices to dried bowl. Add oil, salt, and pepper; toss gently to coat.</li>
        <li>Preheat air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly coat air fryer basket with cooking spray. Working in batches if needed, arrange potato slices in an even layer in basket (do not overcrowd).</li>
        <li>Cook until lightly golden and crispy, 12 to 16 minutes, turning and rearranging chips into an even layer every 4 minutes. Watch closely during the last 2 to 3 minutes of cooking. Check chips about every 30 seconds, using tongs to remove golden chips from the basket as needed to avoid overcooking and ending up with bitter chips.
        </li>
        <li>Let chips cool about 5 minutes. Chips will continue to crisp as they cool.Store in an airtight container up to 3 days.</li>
    </ol>
